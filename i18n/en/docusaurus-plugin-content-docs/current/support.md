# Support

This book is free because the authors did not set a goal to make money from it. However, the book, like any educational resource, requires a lot of time to create and edit. Your support will motivate the authors to continue writing new articles and improving old ones. After payment, you can write to [Telegram](https://t.me/egorvn) or email 7gorbachevm@gmail.com so that your GitHub account will be added to the list of sponsors in the book's README.
